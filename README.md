### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a variety of tags to structure web content. These tags provide the basic building blocks for creating web pages. 
### Brief description of some of the most commonly used HTML tags:

`<!DOCTYPE>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It typically appears at the very beginning of an HTML document.

`<html>`: The root element that wraps all other HTML elements on the page.

`<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character set, and linked stylesheets.

`<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

`<meta>`: Provides metadata about the document, including character encoding, author information, and keywords for search engines.

`<link>`: Used to link external resources such as stylesheets (CSS) to the HTML document.

`<style>`: Allows you to define inline CSS styles for elements within the document.

`<script>`: Used to embed JavaScript code or reference external JavaScript files.

`<body>`: Contains the main content of the web page, including text, images, and other elements visible to the user.

`<h1>`: Headings that create a hierarchical structure for the content, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest.

`<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.

`<a>`: Creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.

`<img>`: Embeds images in the document.

`<div>`: A versatile container element used for grouping and styling content.

`<span>`: A generic inline container for text and other inline elements.
